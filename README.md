# cxmprs
Rust Program that uses Huffman Coding to compress files.

## Building
You need to have `cargo` on your system, then you run
```bash
make clean build
```
And you'll have your binary at `./build/cxmprs`

## Compression
Using:
```bash
# Will output to your_file.cxmp
./cxmprs your_file 
```
#### Try it
```bash
# Output will go to ./ipsum.cxmp
./build/cxmprs ./text/ipsum.txt
```
> Build the program before. See `Bulding` section.

## Decompression
Feature in development 4ever. Too many shit to fix I don't want to think about :)
